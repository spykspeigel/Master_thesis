# Master_thesis: S-Matrix_theory

S-matrix theory was an ambitious program to constrain the possible scattering amplitudes
of Poincare invariant QFTs based on a list of basic tenets expected on physical grounds. The
techniques developed in this program have become relevant again because of their adaptation
to correlators of CFTs. In this project we have studied some aspects of S-matrix theory
that have found recent applications. In this report we review some of technical details of
the basic assumptions, singularity structures, high energy behaviour, analyticity in angular
momentum etc of scattering amplitudes.
